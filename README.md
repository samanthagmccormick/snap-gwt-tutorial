### About the App
Created with webAppCreator, a command line tool included in GWT that generates the project subdirectories and files you need to get started. It creates a starter application.

## Directories

* **/src/com/google/gwt/sample/TodoListApp** Contains the GWT module definition and initial application files.
* **/test/com/google/gwt/sample/TodoListApp** Contains JUnit test directory and a starter test class.
* **/war** Contains static resources that can be served publicly, such as image files, style sheets, and HTML host pages.
* **/war/WEB-INF** Contains Java web application files.
* **/war/WEB-INF/lib** Contains Java web application libraries.

## Files

* **TodoList.gwt.xml** = GWT module definition
* **TodoList.java** = Entry Point:

  * The entry point contains onModuleLoad() methods. It contains the code that executes when you launch the application. Typically, the types of things you do in the onModuleLoad() method are:
   * create new user interface components
   * set up handlers for events
   * modify the browser DOM in some way

* **TodoList.html** = Host page
* **TodoList.css** = Style sheet
* **web.xml** = Java web application descriptor
* **GreetingService.java, GreetingServiceAsync.java, GreetingServiceImpl.java** = GWT sample RPC classes
* **gwt-servlet.jar** = GWT server runtime library
* **Main.java, Main.ui.xml** = UI Binder screen
 * The UiBinder framework allows you to do exactly that: build your apps as HTML pages with GWT widgets sprinkled throughout them
  * encourages a clean separation of the aesthetics of your UI (a declarative XML template) from its programmatic behavior (a Java class);
  * There are no loops, no conditionals, no if statements in its markup, and only a very limited expression language. UiBinder allows you to lay out your user interface. Itâ€™s still up to the widgets or other controllers themselves to convert rows of data into rows of HTML.

### Start the server in SuperDevMode
 * $ cd TodoListApp
 * $ mvn war:exploded
 * $ mvn gwt:run

### Launch the browser
 * In the GWT developer window, press "Launch Default Browser"
 * If you change something in the code, you can recompile the application by simply reloading the web page
 * If you change configuration files, e.g. pom.xml or static content in webapp, you might have to restart SuperDevMode. Ctrl+C and mvn gwt:run stops and starts the execution, respectively.
 
## Importing web components

Before using any component, you have to import the appropriate files. But gwt-polymer-elements comes with some utilities so as you it would be done automatically.

* Widgets : When you use a widget, the import happens automatically  PaperButton button = new PapperButton(); 
* Elements : .create() helper class ex) PaperButtonElement button = Polymer.create(PaperButtonElement.TAG); 
* Dynamic imports : importHref("paper-button/paper-button.html"); 
* Static imports : Adding tags to the hosted page head is the traditional way to make webcomponents available if you want them in a mixed application (DOM, JS, or GWT) or if you want to be sure that web components are available from the beginning.  <link rel='import' href='application_context/bower_components/paper-button/paper-button.html'></link>
